# iTunesU Manager #
iTunesU Manager contains two C# (.NET 2.0) projects.
  * A library which interacts with the iTunesU Web Services API
  * A small Windows utility which utilizes the API and allows basic management of an iTunesU account.

The application requires an existing iTunesU from Apple and access to your school's shared secret and domain name.This application is only meant for use by administrators, not faculty or staff because it gives complete control over your school's iTunesU site.
